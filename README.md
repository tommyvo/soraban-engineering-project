# Bookkeeping System with Automated Categorization

This application is a scalable bookkeeping system designed for efficient transaction management and review. It allows users to manually add or bulk import transactions, automatically categorize them using flexible rule-based logic, and flag anomalies for review. The system features real-time updates via websockets (ActionCable + Redis), enabling instant feedback on transaction changes across all connected clients. Built with Ruby on Rails and React, it is optimized for handling large datasets and provides a user-friendly dashboard for bulk actions, anomaly detection, and streamlined financial oversight.

## Feature Overview & Usage

### Real-Time Updates (ActionCable + Redis)

- All transaction changes (add, update, delete, bulk categorize, CSV import) are broadcast in real-time to all connected clients using ActionCable and Redis.
- No manual refresh is needed‚ÄîUI updates instantly for all users.

**How it works:**
- The Rails backend uses ActionCable to broadcast transaction events (create, update, delete) to a `transactions` channel.
- The React frontend subscribes to this channel and updates the UI state live when a broadcast is received.
- Redis is used as the pub/sub backend, enabling real-time updates even from background jobs or across multiple Rails processes.

### CSV Import

- Import transactions in bulk by uploading a CSV file from the dashboard.
- The import runs as a background job (Sidekiq), so large files do not block the UI.
- Real-time progress: As transactions are imported, they appear live in the UI.
- Handles malformed rows, missing fields, and duplicate detection.
- **Sample Data:** You can use the provided `spec/support/large_transactions.csv` file to import 90 days worth of transactions for testing or demo purposes.

**How it works:**
- The user uploads a CSV file via the dashboard UI.
- The file is sent to the Rails backend, which enqueues a Sidekiq job to process the import in the background.
- Each row is parsed, validated, and saved as a transaction. Duplicates and malformed rows are handled gracefully.
- As transactions are created, ActionCable broadcasts updates so the UI reflects new data in real time.

### Rule Management & Automated Categorization

- Create rules to auto-categorize transactions (e.g., "If description contains 'Uber', set category to 'Transport'").
- Rules are applied automatically to new and imported transactions.
- Rules can be managed from the dashboard (add, edit, delete).

**How it works:**
- Users define rules in the dashboard UI (e.g., match on description or amount).
- When a transaction is created or imported, the backend applies all matching rules to assign a category automatically.
- Rules are stored in the database and can be updated or deleted at any time.

#### Running Auto-Categorization and Anomaly Detection via Rake

You can manually trigger auto-categorization and anomaly detection for all transactions using the following rake tasks:

```bash
rake transactions:auto_categorize
rake transactions:detect_anomalies
```

These tasks are useful after importing a large CSV or making bulk changes. They will process all transactions and update categories and anomaly flags as needed.


### Bulk Categorization

- Select multiple transactions in the UI and assign a category in one action.
- Bulk actions are broadcast in real-time to all clients.

**How it works:**
- The user selects multiple transactions in the table and chooses a category.
- The frontend sends a bulk update request to the backend API.
- The backend updates all selected transactions and broadcasts the changes via ActionCable.
- All connected clients see the updates instantly in their UI.

### Anomaly Detection

- The system flags transactions that are:
    - Unusually large compared to user history
    - Potential duplicates (same date, amount, and description)
    - Missing required metadata (e.g., blank description)
- Flagged transactions are highlighted in the dashboard for review.

**How it works:**
- When a transaction is created or updated, the backend runs anomaly detection logic (e.g., statistical checks, duplicate detection, missing fields).
- Transactions with anomalies are flagged and included in the review dashboard.
- Approving or editing a flagged transaction can clear its anomalies, removing it from the review list.

### Background Jobs (Sidekiq)

- CSV import and other heavy tasks run in the background using Sidekiq.
- Ensure Redis is running for both Sidekiq and ActionCable.
- Monitor Sidekiq jobs at `http://localhost:3000/sidekiq` (if enabled).

**How it works:**
- When a user uploads a CSV or triggers a heavy operation, the backend enqueues a Sidekiq job.
- Sidekiq workers process jobs asynchronously, freeing up the web server for other requests.
- As jobs complete, results are broadcast to the frontend via ActionCable for real-time UI updates.

## TODO

- [ ] Add pagination to transaction lists for better performance with large datasets
- [ ] Add user accounts and authentication using Devise
- [ ] Schedule auto-categorization and anomaly detection rake tasks to run periodically via a cron job

## Advanced Troubleshooting & Tips

- **ActionCable not updating?**
    - Ensure Redis is running (`brew services start redis`).
    - Check that `config/cable.yml` uses the Redis adapter in development.
    - Confirm allowed origins in `config/environments/development.rb` include your frontend URL.
- **CSV import not showing new transactions?**
    - Make sure Sidekiq is running (`bin/dev` starts it by default).
    - Check Sidekiq logs for errors.
- **Tests failing due to ActionCable?**
    - Broadcasting is disabled in test mode to avoid flaky tests.
- **Frontend not updating?**
    - Check browser console for websocket errors.
    - Restart both Rails and Vite servers if needed.

# **Scalable Bookkeeping System with Automated Categorization**

## **Objective**

Build a **minimal yet scalable bookkeeping system** with the following features:

1. **Record & Import Transactions** ‚Äì Users can manually add transactions or import a CSV.
2. **Bulk Actions & Automated Categorization** ‚Äì Users can categorize multiple transactions at once, and automatically assign category (AI-based or rule based).
3. **Anomaly Detection** ‚Äì Identify and flag unusual/suspicous transactions (e.g., large amounts, duplicates, missing metadata).
4. **Scalability & Performance Optimization** ‚Äì Efficiently handle large data sets (e.g., 1m+ transactions).
5. **User-friendly Review System** ‚Äì A dashboard that highlights transactions needing review.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Backend:** Ruby on Rails (preferred), Node.js, Django, or similar.
- **Frontend:** React (preferred) or Vue.js.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (preferred) or MySQL.

## **Project Requirements**

### **1. Record & Import Transactions**

- Users can **manually add transactions** (date, description, amount, category).
- Users can **import a CSV file** containing transactions.
- CSV parsing should handle **edge cases** (missing fields, malformed data, duplicates).

### **2. Bulk Actions & Rule-based Categorization**

- Users can **select multiple transactions** and apply bulk categorization.
- Users can create **rules** like:
    - ‚ÄúIf the description contains ‚ÄòAmazon‚Äô, categorize as ‚ÄòShopping‚Äô.‚Äù
    - ‚ÄúIf amount > $1000, flag as ‚ÄòHigh Value‚Äô.‚Äù
- **Rules should apply automatically** when new transactions are added.

### **3. Anomaly Detection & Fraud Prevention (Challenging Part)**

- Identify transactions that are:
    - **Unusual in amount** compared to past user behavior.
    - **Potential duplicates** (same amount, date, with same descriptions).
    - **Incomplete/missing metadata** (e.g., description missing).
- Flag these anomalies and display them on the **Review Dashboard (Step 5)**

### **4. Scalability & Performance Optimization**

- Your system should handle **1m+ transactions efficiently**.
- Consider **indexing, caching, or batch processing** for performance.

### **5. Review System & UX (Final Challenge)**

- A simple **dashboard** that highlights:
    - **Uncategorized transactions** needing user review.
    - **Flagged anomalies** requiring manual verification.
- Users should be able to **approve, edit, or delete** flagged transactions.

## **Bonus Challenges (For the Overachievers)**

1. **Basic API for Transactions** ‚Äì Expose a REST API for CRUD operations.
2. **Real-time Anomaly Detection** ‚Äì Use WebSockets or polling for updates.
3. **Graph-based Spending Summary** ‚Äì Show user spending trends.
